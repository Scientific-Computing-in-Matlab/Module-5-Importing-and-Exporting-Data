# Module-5 Importing and Exporting Data

In this module you lean to read data files and write output files in various formats.

## Objectives

At the end of this module you will be able to:

 - Explain the difference between text and binary files
 - Use import routines for files with common formats
 - Create a function that reads in data from a text file
 - Create a function that reads in data from a binary file
 - Choose an appropriate output format for your own analyses
 - Generate output files in various formats

## Materials
 1. The [file I/O module on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/home/week/9)
 1. [Import/Export Handout](../docs/importExport.pdf)
 1. Now that you have started writing more complex functions and scripts, you will have more reasons to use the Matlab Debugger. [This tutorial](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/debugging-in-matlab-97189.html) gives a nice introduction, and there is another one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=no&v=PdNY9n8lV1Y) that may also help you understand work spaces, variable scope, and loops better.
